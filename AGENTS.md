# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

## CRITICAL: Start Here

Before processing ANY request, you MUST:
1. Read `@/openspec/project.md` thoroughly to understand:
   - Project purpose and tech stack
   - Code style conventions
   - Architecture patterns
   - Testing strategy
   - Git workflow
   - Domain context and user workflows
   - Important constraints and external dependencies
2. Verify your understanding of the project structure
3. Only then proceed with the request

## When to Use OpenSpec Workflow

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
